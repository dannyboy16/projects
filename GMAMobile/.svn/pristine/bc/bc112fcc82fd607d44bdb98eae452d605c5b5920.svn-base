# This file provides a simple way to register objects that you can't define an standard definition.
#
# SYNTAX: objectname = localization
#	An objectname is the name you want to define for your object located in repository
#	A localization is an expression that identifies your object uniquely. Actually it's only allowed to
#		register xpath expressions. The xpath expression must be preceded with 'xpath' word.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# 	my repository object 		= xpath//*[@id='objectid']
#	another repository object	= xpath//*[@id='anotherid']
#	repository button object	= xpath//button[@id='myid']
#
# USAGE:
#	pushOn("my repository object");
#	verify("another repository object");
#	if (exists("repository button object", 3))
#		pushOn("repository button object");
