# This file provides a simple way to rename tags/nodes of your testing DOM
# All the aliases you create here you can refer them in object's standard configuration file.
#
# SYNTAX: realnodename = alias
# EXAMPLES:
#		button 	= mybutton
#		a		= redefinedlink
#		input	= textinput
#
# USAGE: For refering those nodes in object's standard you can use directly its alias name.
#
# WARNING: The 'realnodename' is directly used for looking in the DOM, if this file has 
#	an incorrect codification you may run into problems with accentuation or similar.
